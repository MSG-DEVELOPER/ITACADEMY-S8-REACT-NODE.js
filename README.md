# ITACADEMY-S8-REACT-MONGO_API

> Sample project for Sprint 8 at IT Academy Barcelona. Includes a React frontend (Vite) and a Node.js backend with MongoDB.

## 📄 Description

This project aims to practice integrating common plugins and storing their data in a database. It is divided into two main parts:

- **Front-end**: A React application featuring:
  - A top navigation menu with links to: Home, Map, FullCalendar, and Charts.
  - Components for an interactive map (Leaflet), an editable calendar (FullCalendar), and charts (Chart.js).

- **Back-end**: A REST API built with **Node.js** and **Express**, using **MongoDB** for data persistence. It provides endpoints for:
  - Users (generic CRUD).
  - Map locations (latitude and longitude).
  - Calendar events.
  - Sample data for bar and line charts.
